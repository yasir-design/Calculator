# OOP Calculator Part 4 - Exception Handling and more list functionality

## Introduction

In this unit, you will learn about exceptions, working with list data, and iterators. You need to make your program
accept a tuple for the calculation class constructor or a single value for the square / square root calculation types. 
You need to make two new calculation types for square and another one for square root. You need to add a custom exception
that gets raised if only one value is found for calculations that require at least 2 values, and you must implement a try 
except in the calculation constructor to handle properly if a tuple or a single value is passed into the create factory 
method.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Note: Previously completed on instances

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. Open Pycharm Pro / Pycharm Community and clone the assignment repository. Open up a terminal in Pycharm, run "pip
   install -r requirements.txt" and then run "pytest".  **If pycharm shows you an error about pip / requirements when
   you clone the repo just skip/cancel/dismiss the error and run the command in the terminal like I said above**
2. You will need to complete the requirements for the assignment and remove/replace the tests that are meant to fail
   that I placed in each file.
3. When your pytest passes just commit and push it back to the origin and the assignment will be graded automatically by
   GitHub running the test that you run locally.
4. Check that your tests pass on GitHub after you push the assignment and then submit a link to your repository to the
   assignment in Canvas. In GitHub on the repository, click the actions tab on GitHub to see your tests run. You will
   need to click on the autograding workflow to inspect that screen to see the detail test results.
