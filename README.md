# Calculator

## Introduction

# Part 1:
Create the multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition functions independently of the class and have tests for these operations as well as the divide by zero exception. Create a calculator class that has four static methods (addition, subtraction, division and multiplication). Each method should call the corresponding function i.e. multiply calls the multiplication function and returns the product.

# Part 2:
The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to the implementation of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. You will learn how to implement static, class, and instance methods as well as be introduced to your first OOP design pattern that is called the "factory pattern." You must write the implementation code to pass the teacher calculation and teacher calculator tests. 

# Part 3:
In this unit you will learn about lists and how to work with them. Lists are important to understand because they are one of the simplest data structures to understand and one of the most common tools for programmers to use. In your program, you will use a list to store calculations in a history class. You will extend the built-in list data structure, so you inherit all the methods that lists use to manage their data.

# Part 4:
In this unit, you will learn about exceptions, working with list data, and iterators. You need to make your program accept a tuple for the calculation class constructor or a single value for the square / square root calculation types. You need to make two new calculation types for square and another one for square root. You need to add a custom exception that gets raised if only one value is found for calculations that require at least 2 values, and you must implement a try except in the calculation constructor to handle properly if a tuple or a single value is passed into the create factory method.
